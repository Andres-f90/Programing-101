# A function is like a closed box, sometimes something enters and sometimes somethings comes out
# Things between parenthesis are the things that get into the box (or in this the funtion)
# When the function is defined the parenthesis are always needed
# Things after `return` are the ones that come out of the function.
# Functions are defined by `def` and after naming it, you start programming the function with `:`
