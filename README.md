## Installing Python

Go to [this LINK](https://www.python.org/) and in the 'Downloads' section you'll find the download button. Follow the installer instructions.

### Environments

When are environments used: Different projects, each with it's own dependencies.

What do they do: They have the packages needed for each project and you can jump between them with ease. Each environment can have a different python version.

> **Anaconda:** Is a distribution for Python and R programming languages that helps (among other things) to manage environments. Using the Anaconda Navigator, you can create and delete environments with just clicks, choosing the python version you desire. You can also edit it's packages, installing, updating and deleting them.

### Creating environments with Anaconda

There are two ways to manage environments with Anaconda:

1. Using Anaconda Navigator: You can follow the instructions in the [Official Anaconda Documentation](https://docs.anaconda.org/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/manage-environments/).
2. Using CMD (Command Prompt): To manage environments with terminal (or CMD), read the [Conda Documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html?highlight=environments).

### Installing Packages

Now that you created an environment, it's time to prepare for the coding session. The next thing you wanna do is install the packages you need. For that, you can also use:

1. Anaconda Navigator: This is the [Official Conda Guide](https://docs.anaconda.org/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/manage-packages/) to manage packages.
2. CMD: This is the [Official Conda Guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html) to manage packages with `conda`.





## First Steps

### Running a Python Script

#### IDLE

djkldjd

#### Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

hjdkd

#### Jupyter Notebooks

[getting started with anaconda](https://anaconda.cloud/tutorials/getting-started-with-anaconda-individual-edition%3Fsource%3Dosx_installer) 

### Print Statement

The `print()` function shows any object (even a function as we will see in the next section) inside the parenthesis in terminal when the file is executed. You can put variables inside the parenthesis, as well as values directly. For example:

>  Python code:
>
> ```python
> print('Hello World!')
> my_variable = 55
> print(my_variable)
> ```
>
> Terminal Response:
>
> ```
> Hello World!
> 55
> ```

### Type Function

The `type()` function is used to display the data type of a value or a variable. You put the desired object inside the parenthesis and it will show the type in the terminal.

>  Python code:
>
>  ```python
>  print(type('Hello World!'))
>  my_variable = 55
>  print(type(my_variable))
>  ```
>
>  Terminal Response:
>
>  ```
>  <class 'str'>
>  <class 'int'>
>  ```

### User Inputs

- This function allows us to read a line from input (inside terminal). 
- It could show a prompt so the user is actually asked something. 

> "A prompt is text or symbols used to represent the system's readiness to perform the next [command](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/command.htm)." - [Computer Hope](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/prompt.htm).

- The prompt is set as the argument the input function recieves. If there is no argument sent, there is not gonna be any prompt in the terminal. 
- The input it recieves is ALWAYS converted into a string and finally returned. 

It works as the example below:

```shell
>>> fav_number = input('What is your favorite number? ')
What is your favorite number? 5
>>> fav_number
"5"
```

(Information obtained from the [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input)).

### Comentaries



## Variables

### Variables vs. Values

> - "Value" is the actual data or instructions stored in computer. Think of it in terms of math: A value is just a thing that never changes, like the number 42, the letter 'H', or the sequence of letters that constitutes "Hello World!".
>
> - "Variable" is a way for locating the data, a value-replacing reference, but not itself the set of data or instruction stored in the computer. Is just a name that stands for a value in a certain scope of the program. Every time a variable is evaluated, its value needs to be looked up in an *environment*.

### Integers

**Definition:** A kind of variable containing a number not decimal

first we name the varible, then we assign the number we want

### Strings
**Definition:** Is a sequence of characters that are in quotes, the different quotes can't be merged
 examples: "hello" - 'hello'
    

first  we need to name the variable, with quotation marks always,  next we write what we want

#### F-Strings
An F-String is defined with the letter `f` and single quotation marks. If we want to input some code inside the String, we can use `{}`. This kind of strings is specially useful to get variables inside the String with ease.

*Example:* `f'This is a String. 5+5={5+5}` is gonna represent `This is a String. 5+5=10`.

> Strings are gonna be seen again later, because they are a complex kind of variable.

####  Change
to change s

### Boolean
**Definition:** the variable Boolean just have two options to assign (false, true)

>  Booleans are gonna be later used in conditionals and loops.

### Float

**Definition:** This is for having a decimal number "the number with a Dot it's called float beacuse it have a comma floating in the number

*Example:*  4.4

## Collections

### Arrays

**Definition:** Arrays are a **MUTABLE** kind of variable, which can store multiple objects inside it, organized by indexes.

> Mutable means it can be later modified.

- An array can contain objects, which can be of every kind.
- An array can also contain objects created before.
- It stores elements in sequence.

In the example below, we have an array called `my_array` that was created with three elements created before and 2 elements (a string and a boolean) created inside it:

```
element_1 = 4.4 # float
element_2 = 5 # int
element_3 = [6, 4, 7] # array

my_array = [element_1, element_2, element_3, 'Hello', False]
```

- **Indexation:** An array index it's elements starting from number `0`. It is specially useful to know because some problems began when you think the first element is the element number 1.
- **Acces:** To acces any item in an array, you need it's index. For example, you can write `my_array[0]` to acces the first element
- **Slice:** To slice an array, you can use the following notation: `[ starting_slice : ending_slice : jump ]`. So, for example if you want to slice an array from the start to the element in index number 5, and you want every 2 elements, you can write `my_array[:5:2]`.
- **Length:** To get the length of an array, use the `len()` function and pass the array as a parameter. Example: `len(my_array)`.

Aside from those uses of arrays, they have some methods which can be found on the [Official Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html). The most important ones are:

- **Append:** Add an element at the end of the array.
- **Insert:** Inserts an element at any index of the array.
- **Pop:** Removes the last element and then returns it.

### String

**Definition:** Strings are basically **UNMUTABLE** lists, and as so, they have some of the previously seen properties, like indexation and slicing. Since strings are unmutable, when you want to make a change to a string, you must create a new and different one.

In addition to those, `Strings` have special methods that can be used following the next example: <string>.<method>(<values>)

The special String methods can be found in the [Official Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str), subsection 'String methods'.

> If it begins with "is" probably is True/False

### Tuples

data structure no mutable  with ordered sequence of elements

b = (1,2,3,4)

counted elements with index

find an element:

    <elem> in <tuple>
    <tuple>.index(<elem>)
    <tuple>.count(<elem>)

### Dictionaries (Or sometimes Hash Tables)

Collection of pair key-value

{'A':45 , 'B':30}

A (key)  45 (value)

with the comma we separate the key-value

the key must be unique

~Access a value:

```python
 <diccionary>[<key>]
 <diccionary>.get(<key>)
```

~Add and modify :

   <diccionary>[<key>] = <new_value>
    (will create a new pair if exists a new key, but if already exists will update the key) 

~Remove

â€‹    del <dicc>[<key>]

~Check if exist

    <elem(key)> in <dicc>

## Functions

Function: name assigned to a process o sequence of specified instructions

variables rules
    only can begging with an letter  like a or A
    only alphanumerical and _

functions are created to do certain tasks faster and with less lines so is easier to not bug and to debug

```python
def <function_name>():
```



### Call a function

the function is called to use the code inside it, it's called like 

```python
<function_name>()
```

parameter: this one is used to be into the function, also can be used in the body of the function, can be one or more parameters in the function

argument: this one is to tell the the parameter what to do like it is a value and the parameter an variable

```python
def operating_marth(x,y):
operating_math(5*90)
```

the up code show us how to do something inside the function, the numbers will be organized like the order we put them in the function

### Recursion



## Expressions

â€‹    merge of values, variables, operators,  resulting in a value

1. Logical operators:

   uses Booleans  

   'and' evaluate from left to right  if are True both operators have to be True

   'or' only if both operators are False will be False

   'not' will change True to False - False for True

   their priority is : not, and, or

2. Relational operators:

   they compare values and return Booleans

   < 	>=

   <	<=

   ==  (equal to)	!= (not equal to)

   can be used with strings

3. Assign operators:

   assign values to variables

   =	+= (add and update value)

   -= (minus and update value)	*=

   /=	**=

   //=	%=

4. Arithmetic operators:

   +,-,*,/,// _floor dision, ** _exponent,% module

   PEMDAS

   -parenthesis

   -exponent

   -multiplication

   -division

   -add

   -minus

### Arguments

## Conditionals

are conditional sentences 
    instruction or group de instructions that the execute is up to a Boolean

### `if` statement

## Loops

### `for` loops

Design to loop through a collection or an iterable object.

it let execute one  or more code lines several times

control structure

for-cycle used for the times we know how many times will  execute repeating the instruction

iteration = reapeat cycle

for <var> in range(<start>,<end>):
    #code

~control variable

descriptive names

updated automatically

    range(start, stop][, step])
    range(start, stop)
    range(stop)
    .
    for <var> in <iterable>:
        #codigo
    for <var> in [<list>]:
        #code
    for <key> in <diccionary>
    for <key> in <diccionary>.values()
    for <keys>,<value> in <diccionary>.items()

iteration: is the way to call the process of doing some specific instructions in code

### `while` loops

Is used for when we don't know how many times the loop must do a iteration
